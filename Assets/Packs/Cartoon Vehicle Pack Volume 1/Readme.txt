All models are set in the prefabs. You will find them in the "Prefabs" folder: "Cartoon Vehicle Pack Volume 1/Prefabs/".
Prefabs are distributed in folders according to the shader used. In the package you will find prefabs with free shaders “Toony Colors Free” as an example. You can read more about this shaders at the link:

Each of the five cars is represented by four prefabs with different shaders as an example.
All you need to do is to add the prefab to the scene.
